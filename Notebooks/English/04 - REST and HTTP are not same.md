## 4\. REST and HTTP are Not the Same

Many people prefer to compare HTTP with REST. **REST and HTTP are not the same.**

Roy Fielding, in his dissertation, has nowhere mentioned any implementation direction – including any protocol preference or even HTTP. Till the time, we are honoring the six guiding principles of REST, which we can call our interface – RESTful.
